#this assignment was actually very diffuclt and caused me to turn this in late
#i wish there was a little more guidance for this assignment
#to make a a program to give you hour and minuts by having the user
#type in hours and type in minutes would be so much more simpler
#but i understand this is school and we need to think out the box
